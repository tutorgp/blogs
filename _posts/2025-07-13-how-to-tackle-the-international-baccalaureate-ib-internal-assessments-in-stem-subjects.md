<h2>2. Developing a Study Plan 📅</h2>
<p>A wellstructured study plan is essential for success. Allocate time for each subject, prioritising areas you find challenging. Remember, consistency is key – a little study every day is more effective than cramming at the last minute.</p>
<h2>3. Personalised Learning 🎓</h2>
