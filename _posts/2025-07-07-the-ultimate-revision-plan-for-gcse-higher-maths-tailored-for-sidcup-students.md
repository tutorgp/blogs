<h2>🔍 Identify Your Weaknesses</h2>

<h2>📝 Active Revision Techniques</h2>
<p>Passive reading won't cut it! Engage in active revision techniques to boost your understanding and retention. Practice past papers, teach a friend, or explain concepts out loud. Utilize flashcards, mind maps, and diagrams to visualize complex ideas. 🧠</p>
