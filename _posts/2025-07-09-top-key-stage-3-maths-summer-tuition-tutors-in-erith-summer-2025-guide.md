<h2>Why Summer Tuition Matters for Key Stage 3 Maths 📊</h2>
<p>Key Stage 3 (Years 79) is a crucial foundation for GCSE Maths and beyond. Summer tuition helps students:</p>
<h2>Catch up on missed topics</h2>
<h3>Get ahead of the curriculum</h3>

<h4>1. Prevent Summer Learning Loss</h4>
<p>Studies show that students can lose 12 months of progress over the summer without structured learning. Summer tuition ensures knowledge retention.</p>
<h5>2. Personalised Learning Approach</h5>
<p>Every student learns differently. A 1to1 tutor tailors lessons to individual strengths and weaknesses, ensuring faster progress.</p>
<h5>3. Exam Prep for Future Success</h5>
<p>Summer tuition prepares students for GCSEs and beyond. Strong Key Stage 3 foundations lead to better results in ALevel Physics, GCSE Science, and more.</p>
