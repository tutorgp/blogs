<h5>📚 Why Summer Tuition Matters</h5>
<p>The summer months can lead to the "summer slide"—a loss of academic skills when students don’t engage with learning. Research shows that students can lose up to two months of progress over the summer, particularly in maths. However, structured summer tuition can help bridge this gap and even get ahead.</p>
<h5>Key Benefits of Summer Tuition:</h5>
<h5>Prevents learning loss: Keeps maths skills sharp</h5>
<h5>Builds confidence: Students revisit tricky topics before exams</h5>
<h5>Improves study habits: Encourages consistent, focused learning</h5>
<h5>Personalised support: Addresses individual weaknesses</h5>
<p>For parents, summer tuition provides peace of mind knowing their child is making progress while still enjoying free time.</p>
