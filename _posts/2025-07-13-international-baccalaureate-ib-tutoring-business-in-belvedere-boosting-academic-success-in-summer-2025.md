<p>Setting achievable, specific, and measurable goals can help motivate your child and provide a sense of direction. Encourage them to set shortterm and longterm goals, and celebrate their achievements along the way.</p>
<h5>Positive Reinforcement 👍</h5>
<p>Positive reinforcement can help boost your child's motivation. Praise their efforts, progress, and improvements, rather than focusing solely on their mistakes.</p>
<h5>Parental Involvement 👫</h5>
<p>Parental involvement is essential for academic success. Attend parentteacher conferences, stay informed about your child's progress, and provide emotional support.</p>
