<h2>Mastering the IB Biology Syllabus 📚</h2>
<p>The IB Biology syllabus is vast, covering topics from cellular processes to ecosystems. Start by familiarising yourself with the syllabus and identify the areas you find challenging. Focus on understanding key concepts rather than memorising facts.</p>
<h2>Developing Effective Study Strategies 📝</h2>
<p>Create a study schedule: Break down your study time into manageable chunks and allocate specific time slots for each topic.</p>
<p>Active learning: Engage with the material, not just passively read. Try teaching the concepts to a friend or even a teddy bear!</p>
<p>Practice, practice, practice: Solve past papers and quizzes to get a feel for the exam format and improve your time management skills.</p>
