<h2>🧪 Master IB Chemistry Group 17 Elements with Tutor GP 📚</h2>
<p>Welcome to Tutor GP, your trusted partner in academic success! Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of IB Chemistry Group 17 Elements. Whether you're a student, a parent, a tutor, or a teacher, this blog post is designed to help you unlock the potential of Group 17 elements and boost your understanding of IB Chemistry.</p>
<h2>🔬 What are Group 17 Elements in IB Chemistry?</h2>
<p>Group 17, also known as the Halogens, is a group of elements in the periodic table. These elements are highly reactive due to their electron configuration, eager to fill their outermost electron shell. Let's take a closer look at the Group 17 elements: Fluorine (F), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br), Iodine (I), Astatine (At), and Polonium (Po), and the radioactive element, Radon (Rn).</p>
