<h2>🎓 Mastering Study Skills</h2>
<p>One of the most crucial elements to academic success is building strong study skills. Here's a simple yet effective technique:</p>

<h2>👩‍🏫 Personalised Learning</h2>
<p>Every student is unique, and so should be their approach to learning. Tailoring your study methods to your learning style can make a significant difference:</p>
<h2>3. Visual Learners: Use diagrams, mind maps, or colourcoding to aid understanding.</h2>
<p>4. Auditory Learners: Record lectures, listen to educational podcasts, or use voice notes to revise.</p>
<p>5. Kinesthetic Learners: Try handson activities, such as building models or teaching a concept to someone else.</p>
