<h4>`a / b = b / a` (Division)</h4>
<h4>2. Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) 🎯</h4>
<h4>Brackets/parentheses</h4>
<h5>Indices/Exponents</h5>
<h5>Division and Multiplication (left to right)</h5>
<h5>Addition and Subtraction (left to right)</h5>
<h5>📝 Algebraic Expressions</h5>
<h5>3. Factoring 🔨</h5>
<h5>`a^2  b^2 = (a + b)(a  b)`</h5>
<h5>4. Expanding Brackets 🎯</h5>
<h5>`(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2`</h5>
<h5>`(a  b)^2 = a^2  2ab + b^2`</h5>

<h5>`3ab + 6ab = 9ab`</h5>
<h5>📝 Indices (Exponents)</h5>
<h5>6. Multiplying and Dividing Indices 🤝</h5>
<h5>`a^m  a^n = a^(m + n)`</h5>
<h5>`a^m / a^n = a^(m  n)`</h5>
<h5>7. Changing the Base 🔄</h5>
<h5>`a^m  b^m = (ab)^m`</h5>
<h5>`(a^m)^n = a^(mn)`</h5>
<h5>8. Negative Indices 🔄</h5>
<h5>`a^m = 1/a^m`</h5>
<h5>📝 Quadratic Equations</h5>
<h5>9. Finding the Discriminant 🤝</h5>
<h5>Discriminant: `b^2  4ac`</h5>
<h5>10. Solving Quadratic Equations (Two Real Roots) 🎯</h5>
<h5>Roots: `(b ± √(b^2  4ac)) / 2a`</h5>
<h5>11. Solving Quadratic Equations (One Real Root) 🤝</h5>
<h5>Root: `b / 2a`</h5>
<h5>12. Solving Quadratic Equations (Complex Roots) 🎯</h5>
<h5>Roots: `(b ± √(b^2  4ac)) / 2a` with `b^2  4ac < 0`</h5>
<h5>📝 Trigonometry</h5>
<h5>13. Sine, Cosine, and Tangent 🤝</h5>
<h5>Sine: `sin(θ) = opp/hyp`</h5>
<h5>Cosine: `cos(θ) = adj/hyp`</h5>
<h5>Tangent: `tan(θ) = opp/adj`</h5>
<h5>14. Reciprocal Identities 🔄</h5>
<h5>Reciprocal Sine: `(1/sin(θ)) = 1/opps`</h5>
<h5>Reciprocal Cosine: `(1/cos(θ)) = 1/adj`</h5>
<h5>Reciprocal Tangent: `(1/tan(θ)) = 1/opp`</h5>
<h5>15. Pythagorean Theorem 🎯</h5>
<h5>`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`</h5>
<h5>16. HalfAngle Formulas 🤝</h5>
<h5>`sin(θ/2) = ± √((1  cos(θ)) / 2)`</h5>
<h5>`cos(θ/2) = ± √((1 + cos(θ)) / 2)`</h5>
<h5>17. Sum and Difference Formulas 🤝</h5>
<h5>`sin(a + b) = sin(a)cos(b) + cos(a)sin(b)`</h5>
<h5>`cos(a + b) = cos(a)cos(b)  sin(a)sin(b)`</h5>
<h5>📝 Sequences, Series, and Probability</h5>
<h5>18. Arithmetic Sequences and Series 🤝</h5>
<h5>Arithmetic Mean (Average): `(sum of terms) / (number of terms)`</h5>
<p>Arithmetic Progression (AP): `a_n = a_1 + (n  1)d` where `d` is the common difference</p>
<h5>19. Geometric Sequences and Series 🤝</h5>
<h5>Geometric Mean (Average): `(product of terms)^(1/n)`</h5>
<p>Geometric Progression (GP): `a_n = a_1  r^(n  1)` where `r` is the common ratio</p>
<h5>20. Probability 🎲</h5>
<h5>Total Probability: `P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B)`</h5>
<h5>Union: `P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)  P(A and B)`</h5>
