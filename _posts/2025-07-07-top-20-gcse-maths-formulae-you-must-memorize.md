<h2>📚 Top 20 GCSE Maths Formulae You Must Memorize 🚀</h2>
<p>Welcome, students, parents, tutors, and teachers! As we embark on this exciting journey, let's dive into the world of GCSE Maths, focusing on the top 20 formulae that will be your secret weapons for academic success.</p>
<h2>🎯 Essential GCSE Maths Formulae</h2>
<h2>1. BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS Rule 💡</h2>
<h2>Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction</h2>
<h3>Master this rule to solve complex expressions correctly.</h3>
<h3>2. Quadratic Formula 🔄</h3>
<h4>`x = (b ± √(b²  4ac)) / 2a`</h4>
<h4>Solve any quadratic equation with ease!</h4>
<h4>3. Percentage Calculations 💰</h4>
<h5>`Amount = Original Price × Percentage (as a decimal)`</h5>
<h5>`Percentage = (Amount / Original Price) × 100`</h5>
<h5>Don't forget the inverse percentages as well!</h5>
<h5>4. Mean, Median, Mode, and Range 📊</h5>
<h5>Mean: `(Sum of all values) / (Number of values)`</h5>
<p>Median: `(Value at (Number of values) / 2) if the data set has an odd number of values`</p>
<h5>Mode: `The value(s) that appear most frequently in the data set`</h5>
<h5>Range: `Highest value  Lowest value`</h5>
<h5>5. Probability 🎲</h5>
<p>`P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) if A and B are mutually exclusive`</p>
<p>`P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) if A and B are independent`</p>
<h5>6. Trigonometry Basics 🌐</h5>
<h5>`sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse`</h5>
<h5>`cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse`</h5>
<h5>`tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent`</h5>
<h5>7. Pythagorean Theorem ometry</h5>
<h5>`a² + b² = c²`</h5>
<h5>Use this to find the length of the hypotenuse in rightangled triangles.</h5>
<h5>8. Equations of a Circle 🌐</h5>
<h5>`(x  h)² + (y  k)² = r²`</h5>
<p>Find the equation of a circle with centre (h, k) and radius r.</p>
<h5>9. Area and Volume Calculations 📏</h5>
<h5>`Area of a Square = Side²`</h5>
<h5>`Area of a Rectangle = Length × Width`</h5>
<h5>`Area of a Triangle = 1/2 × Base × Height`</h5>
<h5>`Area of a Circle = πr²`</h5>
<h5>`Volume of a Cube = Side³`</h5>
<h5>`Volume of a Cuboid = Length × Width × Height`</h5>
<h5>10. Graphs 📈</h5>
<p>Learn to plot equations, understand coordinates, and identify key features like intercepts and gradients.</p>
