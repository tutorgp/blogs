<h2>🎓 Students: Unlock Your Potential with Calculator Skills</h2>

<p>1. Understand the calculator's limits: Not all calculators are equal, and some functions may not be permitted in exams. Familiarise yourself with the one provided and know which functions are allowed.</p>
<p>2. Know the basics: Make sure you're comfortable with the common operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Being proficient in these fundamental operations will set a strong foundation for more complex problems.</p>
<p>3. Practice, practice, practice: The more you practice, the better you'll become. Regularly use your calculator in your homework and revision to build confidence and speed.</p>
<h2>💼 Parents: Support Your Child's Success</h2>
<p>As a parent, you play a crucial role in your child's academic journey. Here's how you can help:</p>
<p>1. Buy a suitable calculator: Ensure your child has a suitable calculator for GCSE Maths, and help them learn its functions.</p>
<p>2. Encourage practice: Encourage your child to use their calculator during study sessions and homework. This will help them feel more comfortable during exams.</p>
<p>3. Monitor progress: Keep an eye on your child's progress and offer support when needed. If you notice any areas of difficulty, consider seeking professional help from Tutor GP.</p>
